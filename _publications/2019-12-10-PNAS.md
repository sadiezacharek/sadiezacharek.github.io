title: "Ventral hippocampus interacts with prelimbic cortex during inhibition of threat response via learned safety in both mice and humans"

excerpt: 'In parallel studies across species, we identify a pathway that engages the ventral hippocampus for the attenuation of threat responses through conditioned inhibition. Conditioned inhibition relies on the specific involvement of ventral hippocampal neurons projecting to the prelimbic cortex in mice and homologous ventral hippocampalâ€“dorsal anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity in humans.'
